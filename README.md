# Firebase Authentication Initialization Error

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the Firebase Authentication SDK: attempting to use the SDK before it's fully initialized.  The `firebaseBug.js` file shows the erroneous code, while `firebaseSolution.js` presents the corrected version.

**Problem:**  Calling Firebase authentication methods before the Firebase app is initialized results in errors because the SDK is not ready.

**Solution:** Ensure Firebase is fully initialized before making any authentication-related calls. This usually involves using a promise or async/await to handle the asynchronous initialization process.
