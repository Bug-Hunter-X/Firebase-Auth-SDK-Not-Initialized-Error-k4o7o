The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an error if you try to use it before it's fully initialized.  This can happen if you call authentication methods immediately within the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method of a React component, or a similar function in other frameworks. Firebase initialization is asynchronous, meaning it takes some time to complete. If your authentication call executes before the initialization finishes, it will fail.
